# LinkDetector

## Overview

**LinkDetector** is a C++ program designed to identify missing connections within a network of nodes. The algorithm detects pairs of nodes that are not directly connected and provides a count and detailed list of these missing connections.

## Features

- Detects and counts missing connections in a network.
- Outputs the pairs of nodes that are not directly connected.
- Efficient and easy to use.

## Usage

### Input

The program expects two main inputs:
1. `n`: The number of nodes (students).
2. `m`: The total number of possible connections (maximum node value).

For each node, the program reads the number of connections they have and the specific nodes they are connected to.

### Output

- The program outputs the total count of missing connections.
- It also lists the pairs of nodes that are not directly connected.

### Example

```
Input:
5 4
1 1
2 2 3
1 4
3 1 2 4
2 2 3

Output:
2
1 3
3 4
```
